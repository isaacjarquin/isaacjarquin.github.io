Im Isaac Jarquin, originally from Gran Canaria, hence my like for water sports such as Surf, buggy board, swimming ... I'm currently working for Sky UK, a well establish company set in the UK. I have about 6 years of experience in Ruby and OOP in general and I'm started to get very exited passionate about functional programming and currently learning elixir.

Living in the uk makes practicing surf a bit complicated so in my free time I also like to go hiking, practice sports, preferible outdoors and read.
