Im Isaac Jarquin, originally from Gran Canaria, hence my like for water sports such as Surf, boogie board, swimming ... I'm currently working for Sky UK, a well established company set in the UK. I have about 8 years of experience in software development. I have a sound knowledge of OOP and I'm starting to get very exited and passionate about functional programming. Along the languages and frameworks that I have been using are Ruby, Elixir, Javascript, Rails, Sinatra, React, React Native, and Redux.

Living in the uk makes practicing surf a bit complicated so in my free time I also like to go hiking, practice sports, love the outdoors and read.
